 Benchmarking Large Language Models for Geolocating Colonial Virginia Land Grants. This repository contains code, data, and results from a systematic study evaluating how accurately modern LLMs can convert 17th and 18th-century narrative land grant descriptions into geographic coordinates. The study demonstrates that state-of-the-art language models can outperform traditional GIS workflows in accuracy (23.4km vs 71.4km mean error) while reducing costs by two orders of magnitude and processing time from hours to seconds. Includes a digitized corpus of 5,471 abstracts from Cavaliers and Pioneers Vol. 3 (1695-1732), validation datasets with ground truth coordinates, and full experimental code for both one-shot and tool-augmented approaches.
