This repository contains code, data, and results for the paper "Benchmarking Large Language Models for Geolocating Colonial Virginia Land Grants."

## Abstract

This study evaluates whether state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) can convert narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions from Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patent abstracts into usable latitude/longitude coordinates. We digitized 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695â€“1732) from *Cavaliers and Pioneers* Vol. 3, with a rigorously annotated ground-truth dataset of 45 georeferenced test cases.

We benchmark six OpenAI models spanning three architecture families under two prompting paradigms: (i) one-shot "direct-to-coordinate" and (ii) tool-augmented chain-of-thought that invokes external geocoding APIs. The best purely textual model (OpenAI o3-2025-04-16) achieves a mean great-circle error of 23.4 km (median 14.3 km), a 67% improvement over a professional GIS baseline (71.4 km), while cutting cost and latency by roughly two and three orders of magnitude, respectively.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryanmio/virginia-land-grants-llm.git
cd virginia-land-grants-llm

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

This repository includes:

- **Raw data**: Original abstracts from *Cavaliers and Pioneers* Vol. 3 (1695-1732)
- **Validation sets**: 
  - `validation-dev-A.csv` and `validation-dev-B.csv`: Development sets used for prompt engineering
  - `validation-test.csv`: The test set with 45 ground-truth coordinates

## Usage

### Running Experiments

To run the main experiment with default settings:

```bash
python code/run_experiment.py --evalset data/processed/validation-test.csv
```

Options:
- `--evalset`: Path to evaluation dataset CSV
- `--methods-file`: Path to YAML defining models and methods (default: config/methods.yaml)
- `--prompts-file`: Path to YAML defining prompts (default: config/prompts.yaml)
- `--dry-run`: Skip OpenAI API calls and generate mock predictions
- `--max-rows`: Process at most N rows (for quick tests)
- `--verbose`: Print detailed progress info

### Creating Maps

To generate maps for individual grants:

```bash
python code/mapping/map_one_grant.py --grant_id 1
```

For batch mapping:

```bash
python code/mapping/batch_map.py --input results/full_results.csv
```

### Generating Plots

The `code/analysis/` directory contains scripts for generating all figures from the paper:

```bash
python code/analysis/plot_accuracy_bar.py
python code/analysis/plot_violin_methods.py
python code/analysis/plot_pareto.py
# etc.
```

## Key Findings

1. State-of-the-art LLMs can georeference colonial land grants with greater accuracy than traditional GIS workflows (23.4 km vs 71.4 km mean error).

2. One-shot "direct-to-coordinate" prompting outperforms tool-augmented approaches that use external geocoding APIs.

3. Cost-per-1000-grants ranges from $1.09 (GPT-4o) to $137.44 (o3), compared to $3,255.81 for professional GIS methods.

4. Processing time is reduced from hours (432s per grant) to seconds (0.7-48s per grant).

5. LLMs demonstrate robust performance across different abstract lengths and parameter settings.
